### Project Description
Cook N Count is a pixel-themed cooking assistant that listens to your cooker whistles, counts them automatically, runs a cooking timer, and even gives you cooking advice via our chatbot ‚ÄúKunjuttan.‚Äù Basically, it‚Äôs like having a retro video game chef watching your pot ‚Äî and cheering when your dish is done.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever forgot how many whistles your cooker made while you were busy scrolling memes?
Or maybe you can‚Äôt tell if your rice is ready because you were too busy whistling along?
Exactly. We‚Äôre here to solve this non-problem for you.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We gave your cooker super-hearing.
Our app listens for whistles, counts them, shows a pixel cooker shaking in excitement, and Kunjuttan tells you whether your chicken curry still needs ‚Äúone more toot‚Äù or not.
Oh, and there‚Äôs an alarm ‚Äî because the rice won‚Äôt text you when it‚Äôs done.
